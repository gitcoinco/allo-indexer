# Allo Protocol Indexer

The Allo Protocol Indexer is a tool that indexes blockchain events generated by [Allo contracts](https://github.com/Allo-Protocol/contracts) and serving the data over HTTP in JSON format. The data is organized in a specific structure that enables easy access to different parts of the protocol. The indexer is built using [Chainsauce](https://github.com/boudra/chainsauce) and is designed to work with any EVM-compatible chain.

The indexer data is used by [Grants Stack](https://github.com/gitcoinco/grants-stack) to show stats and allocate matching funds.

# Indexed Data

Access indexed data through this URL: https://indexer-grants-stack.gitcoin.co

The indexed data follows this structure:

```
/{chainId}/rounds.json
/{chainId}/prices.json
/{chainId}/projects.json
/{chainId}/rounds/{roundId}/projects.json
/{chainId}/rounds/{roundId}/projects/{projectId}/votes.json
/{chainId}/rounds/{roundId}/projects/{projectId}/contributors.json
/{chainId}/rounds/{roundId}/applications.json
/{chainId}/rounds/{roundId}/applications/{applicationIndex}/votes.json
/{chainId}/rounds/{roundId}/votes.json
/{chainId}/rounds/{roundId}/contributors.json
```

The indexer is monitoring the following chains with their respective chain IDs:

- Ethereum Mainnet: 1
- Ethereum Goerli Testnet: 5
- Optimism: 10
- Fantom: 250

## How to run?

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start # this runs the production start script which will index all chains
```

You can also run the index script to just index, use the follwing options to change it's behaviour:

```bash
npm run index -- --chain=mainnet --to-block=16833357 # run only to the specified block, useful to maximize cache usage
npm run index -- --chain=mainnet --from-block=16994526 # run only from the specified block, useful to index only the latest events
npm run index -- --chain=mainnet --follow # follow the blockchain, this runs as a long running process indexing events as they happen
npm run index -- --chain=mainnet --clear # clear the indexed data before indexing
npm run index -- --chain=mainnet --no-cache # run without a cache
```

## Development

**Please make sure you set the environment variables before running, find a `.env` template in `.env.example`**

Run the indexer:

```
npm run start:dev:mainnet
```

Then check the new files generated under `data/1`.

### HTTP Server

The server will run under port 4000, check it here: http://localhost:4000/

## Deployment

The indexer is currently automatically deployed on [Fly.io](Fly.io) from the `main` branch. We reindex everything from scratch on each deploy, we only persist the cache, which includes events and IPFS data.

The following commands might be useful for monitoring production:

```bash
fly status # show general status of the app, all VMs and their status
fly logs # check logs of running VM, it also shows logs of deployments in progress
fly ssh console # open a console to the runnning VM
```
